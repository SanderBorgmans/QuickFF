QuickFF is a Python package developed at the 
`Center for Molecular Modeling <https://molmod.ugent.be/>`_ (CMM) to quickly 
derive accurate force fields from ab initio calculations. This website contains
all information on how to install and use QuickFF. A detailed description of the
methodology used by QuickFF to derive the force fields can be found in the 
:ref:`corresponding papers <seclab_literature>`.
